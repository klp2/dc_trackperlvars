# dc_trackperlvars - Damian Conway's nifty perl variable manipulation plugin.

Originally downloaded from https://www.bit.do/VAPIDE.

# Why?

To make it easier for me to integrate Damian's work with the other work
that I've mostly borrowed from other people.

# What?
  * easily rename variables
  * easily find undeclared/unused variables
  * display info from comments on same line
  * probably other stuff
